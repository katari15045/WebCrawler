Say you need to find the exact location of JDK in your linux system.
whereis java
It may return /usr/bin/java
ls -al /usr/bin/java
It may return java -> /etc/alternatives/java
ls -al /etc/alternatives/java
Now you can find it.

Note : /usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java -> actual JDK
i.e /usr/bin/java & /etc/alternatives/java are symbolic links
