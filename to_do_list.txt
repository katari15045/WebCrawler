1. When you try to insert duplicate ul in MySQL your .java file should handle it -> Need to check this corner case
2. Need to remove some prepositions(in, at, on etc) in the query that user enters. Reason being, Solr searches for each word that user enters and if 'in' is not removed then Solr gives us the results that may only contain 'in'
